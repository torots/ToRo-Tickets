Welcome to the toro Ticketing System 
toroTS is a branch of OsTicket Reloaded / OsTicket.  It builds on top of the OST-R 1.6ST release which supports several localizations or languages. 

Developers, who would like to contribute to make this osTicket fork successful are more than welcome to join toroTS. 

Translators who would like to contribute a new language feel free to download the base translate.php (english) and adjust it. New files can be added using Git or can be sent to the email address mentionted below.

Some additional features that we have added:
 * control of columns, displays and weights.
 * easier theme/layout control (its not fully themable but we hope to get it there)
 * ticket age column
 * css mouseover tooltips
 * LDAP Authentication
