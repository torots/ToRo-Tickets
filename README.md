Introduction
============

[ToroTS](http://torots.com/) 
Welcome to the Toro Ticketing System 

ToroTS has it's origin as a fork of [OsTicket Reloaded](https://github.com/jasperf/OSTicket-Reloaded), which in turn is based on OsTicket 1.6ST release.  [ToroTS](http://torots.com/) supports several localizations or languages.  We would like to further enhance, correct and clean and extend the current codebase and bring it up to speed to current coding stanards and good PHP practices.

#### Main features of the ToroTS fork
 * control of columns, displays and weights.
 * easier theme/layout control (its not fully themable but we hope to get it there)
 * ticket age column
 * css mouseover tooltips
 * LDAP Authentication 
 * Translations done differently

#### Additional improvements
- Bugs reported against the original osTicket release that we know about and can fix will be fixed.
